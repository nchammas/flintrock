# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/compare/v0.5.0...master

### Added

* [#115]: Flintrock can now resize existing clusters with the new
  `add-slaves` and `remove-slaves` commands.

[#115]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/pull/115

### Changed

* [#115]: If you lost your master somehow, Flintrock can now still
  destroy the cluster.
* [#115]: You can no longer launch clusters with 0 slaves. The
  implementation was broken. We may fix and add this capability back
  in the future.

## [0.5.0] - 2016-07-20

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0

### Added

* [#118]: You can now specify `--hdfs-download-source` (or the
  equivalent in your config file) to tell Flintrock to download Hadoop
  from a specific URL when launching your cluster.
* [#125]: You can now specify `--spark-download-source` (or the
  equivalent in your config file) to tell Flintrock to download Spark
  from a specific URL when launching your cluster.
* [#112]: You can now specify `--ec2-security-group` to associate
  additional security groups with your cluster on launch.

[#112]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/pull/112

### Changed

* [#103], [#114]: Flintrock now opens port 6066 and 7077 so local
  clients like Apache Zeppelin can connect directly to the Spark
  master on the cluster.
* [#122]: Flintrock now automatically adds executables like
  `spark-submit`, `pyspark`, and `hdfs` to the default `PATH`, so
  they're available to call right when you login to the cluster.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0

### Added

* [#98], [#99]: You can now specify `latest` for `--spark-git-commit`
  and Flintrock will automatically build Spark on your cluster at the
  latest commit. This feature is only available for Spark repos
  hosted on GitHub.
* [#94]: Flintrock now supports launching clusters into non-default
  VPCs.

### Changed

* [#86]: Flintrock now correctly catches when spot requests fail and
  bubbles up an appropriate error message.
* [#93], [#97]: Fixed the ability to build Spark from git. (It was
  broken for recent commits.)
* [#96], [#100]: Flintrock launches should now work correctly whether
  the default Python on the cluster is Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+.

## [0.3.0] - 2016-02-14

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0

### Changed

* [`eca59fc`], [`3cf6ee6`]: Tweaked a few things so that Flintrock
  can launch 200+ node clusters without hitting certain limits.

[`eca59fc`]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/commit/eca59fc0052874d9aa48b7d4d7d79192b5e609d1
[`3cf6ee6`]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/commit/3cf6ee64162ceaac6429d79c3bc6ef25988eaa8e

## [0.2.0] - 2016-02-07

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0

### Added

* [`b00fd12`]: Added `--assume-yes` option to the `launch` command.
  Use `--assume-yes` to tell Flintrock to automatically destroy the
  cluster if there are problems during launch.

[`b00fd12`]: https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/commit/b00fd128f36e0a05dafca69b26c4d1b190fa42c9

### Changed

* [#69]: Automatically retry Hadoop download from flaky Apache
  mirrors.
* [`0df7004`]: Delete unneeded security group after a cluster is
  destroyed.
* [`244f734`]: Default HDFS not to install. Going forward, Spark will
  be the only service that Flintrock installs by default. Defaults can
  easily be changed via Flintrock's config file.
* [`de33412`]: Flintrock installs services, not modules. The
  terminology has been updated accordingly throughout the code and
  docs. Update your config file to use `services` instead of
  `modules`. **Warning**: Flintrock will have problems managing
  existing clusters that were launched with versions of Flintrock from
  before this change.
* [#73]: Major refactoring of Flintrock internals.
* [#74]: Flintrock now catches common configuration problems upfront
  and provides simple error messages, instead of barfing out errors
  from EC2 or launching broken clusters.
* [`bf766ba`]: Fixed a bug in how Flintrock polls SSH availability
  from Linux. Cluster launches now work from Linux as intended.
