# Notes:
#   - Run pip from Flintrock's root directory, not from the
#     directory containing this file.
#   - The `-e .` syntax lets us reuse the requirements already
#     specified under `install_requires` in setup.py.
#     See: https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/
#   - The #egg= syntax is a workaround for pip-tools.
